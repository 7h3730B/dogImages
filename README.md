# dogImages
Replaces every image on a website to dog images
## PLS don't use this. It makes a request for every image to: [dog.ceo](https://dog.ceo/) 
## TODO:
Maybe store the pictures in some kind of cache so it only makes a request for example 200 pictures stores them and then gets the pictures from the cache
